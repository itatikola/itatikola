# Hi, everyone! 💃
### Last Updated: 06/10/2024
My name is Indira (in-deer-uh, she/her) and I'm a CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in Intelligence and Systems & Architecture.

I have a passion for making technology that makes our world more accessible and making technology more accessible for everyone in the world.

👩‍💻 I'm currently working on an in-depth JavaScript project on [my personal website](www.itatikola.com) to help me with my intern project this summer at Akamai Technologies.
