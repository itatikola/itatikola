# Hello! 
### Last Updated: 06/10/2024
My name is Indira (in-deer-uh, she/her) and I'm a rising junior studying CS at the Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in Intelligence and Systems & Architecture.

👩‍💻 I'm currently working on an in-depth JavaScript project to help me with my intern project this summer at Akamai Technologies.

🔗 I'm also looking for summer 2025 internships in software engineering. If you're a recruiter, please reach out! I would love to learn more about your company's early career opportunities and culture.
